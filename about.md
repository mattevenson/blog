Hi, I'm Matt! I'm currently focused on bringing [ELT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_load,_transform) to blockchain data at [Superkey](https://github.com/superkeyio).

In the past, I've written code at [Retool](https://retool.com/), [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/), [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), and [Google](https://www.google.com/).
